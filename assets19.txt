2: What was the baseline level of knowledge or capability did the business have prior to undertaking this R&D activity?

At the commencement of the project, the company possessed a foundational understanding of tools such as the Unreal Gaming engine, 3DS Max, and Nvidia's CUDA set, with the intention of leveraging GPUs for parallelism. The project involved extending these tools, filling gaps, and maximizing the use of GPUs to create a detailed model of the site and architectural specifications using the Unreal Engine. However, the company discovered that gaming tools, while initially appearing suitable, diverged from their need for photorealistic, finely detailed representations. This was due to gaming engines prioritizing performance over photorealism, and the coarse-grained geometry of gaming engines contrasting with their need for fine-grained geometry. 

The company's pursuit of realistic representation for the construction industry necessitated a high level of detail, which was not a priority in the gaming world that focuses on the physics engine and performance, not on presenting geometries in real time. When the Unreal Engine was used for different geometries and vertices, the engine significantly slowed, presenting a problem they had to address.

The specific gap in the knowledge or capability that existed at the start of the project was the Unreal Engine's inability to efficiently handle dense geometries and polygon computation. The current technology was limiting them from completing the project because the gaming engines prioritized performance over photorealism, which was not suitable for their need for photorealistic, finely detailed representations. 

Externally available knowledge or capability included the Unreal Gaming engine, 3DS Max, and Nvidia's CUDA set. However, these tools had limitations and were not fully equipped to handle their specific needs. At the start of the R&D project, computer science or technology couldn’t efficiently handle dense geometries and polygon computation in a way that would allow for photorealistic, finely detailed representations. 

Upon further research, it was found that leading companies in the field of photorealistic rendering such as The Motion Tree, Webrotate 360, PICSERA, VRender, Arqui 9, Brick Visual, Binyan Studios, The Boundary, Mir, Luxigon, and Kilograph, offer key products or services including 3D imagery, 3D rendering services, 3D visualization, and 3D mapping. Photorealistic rendering is a process that involves developing images from 3D models, with the software used generating an image that appears real and life-like. This technique uses 3D rendering software to generate lifelike images and animations using physically based virtual lights

The business aimed to achieve a significant advancement in the field of virtual reality (VR) technology, specifically for the construction industry. The primary focus was to develop a VR platform capable of rendering highly detailed and accurate architectural models in real-time, which is a significant challenge due to the computational resources required. 

The business sought to overcome the limitations of existing gaming engines, such as Unreal Engine, which prioritize performance over photorealism. The team aimed to enhance these engines to handle fine-grained geometry, which is crucial for creating photorealistic representations in the construction industry. 

To automate the process of adding offsets to relevant geometries and polygons, a task that was previously done manually and was time-consuming, the business developed new algorithms and techniques. These included the use of Polygon offset, Boost Polygon library, Maximum Z slope, offsetDistance, Maximum Offset Covering, grid.polyoffset(), grid.polylineoffset(), Offset Edge Loop Tool, and Set Vertex Position dialog. The purpose of adding offsets to relevant geometries and polygons is to allow the application to specify a depth offset with two parameters, factor and units. Factor scales the maximum Z slope, and the offset operation constructs offset polygons at distance offsetDistance for each face of the current shape's geometry. 

The business also sought to develop a solution for handling the Earth's curvature in 3D space, a feature not supported by existing tools like 3DS Max. This required the development of new components in C++, exposed to Max script, the programming language for 3DS Max.

The advancements sought by the business are considered genuine and non-trivial by competent professionals due to the complexity of the challenges involved and the lack of existing solutions in the field. The advancements demonstrate a new or appreciable improvement over the industry baseline by enabling the creation of highly detailed and accurate VR models in real-time, a capability not currently offered by existing VR platforms.

The business plans to release tools on GitHub and discuss their work in a trade publication, further contributing to the advancement of knowledge in the field. This will also differentiate the company from its competitors and set a new industry standard.

4: What technological uncertainties did the business face?

The business faced several technological uncertainties in their pursuit of scientific progress, particularly in the fields of virtual reality, gaming engines, and GPU utilization. One of the main challenges was the development of a virtual reality support tool for the construction industry, specifically for the Chinese market. The tool aimed to provide real-time envisioning of designs, which required a high level of precision and detail. 

The business used tools like Unreal Gaming engine and 3DS Max, aiming to utilize GPUs for parallelism. However, they encountered significant challenges due to the coarse-grained geometry of gaming engines, which contrasted with their need for fine-grained geometry. The gaming engines prioritized performance over photorealism, which was not suitable for their needs. When they used the Unreal Engine for different geometries and vertices, the engine slowed significantly, presenting a technological barrier to their progress.

Another technological uncertainty was the handling of dense geometries using the Unreal Engine. The business aimed to group geometries or polygons with similar characteristics and then apply offsets to the lead node and its cluster members. However, adding offsets made the engine even slower, presenting another technological challenge.

Furthermore, the business faced challenges with the NVIDIA tool chain. There were parts of the NVIDIA tool chain that were not working properly, and the business had to address this by improving performance. However, this did not solve the problem entirely, and they had to build out the deficits themselves to move their project forward.

In addition, the business had to deal with the problem of Earth curvature, which required a high level of precision due to its material impact on calculations over 20 or 30 miles. They built their own components in 3DS Max using C++, but encountered many problems in the process.

These technological uncertainties significantly affected the overall progress of the business. The uncertainties created challenges for managers to rely on established strategies, necessitating cost-cutting measures and the development of new strategies to address broader factors. The uncertainties also impacted the business's ability to anticipate and prepare for potential disruptions, and to pivot when unforeseen events occurred. This was particularly evident in the business's struggles with the Unreal Engine and NVIDIA tool chain, which required them to build out deficits and develop new components. The uncertainties also had a material impact on the business's financial performance, changing consumer preferences, and the broader factors impacting the business. Despite these challenges, the business continued to strive for scientific progress, demonstrating resilience and adaptability in the face of technological uncertainty.

5: How did the business plan to overcome the technical uncertainties?

The business planned to overcome the technical uncertainties by focusing on scientific and technological advancements in the field of software engineering, specifically in the areas of virtual reality, photogrammetry, and high-resolution photography. The main technical challenge was the precision required in architectural design for the construction industry, particularly in maintaining the skyline and considering the Earth's curvature. 

The business team attempted to resolve this by using tools like Unreal Gaming engine and 3DS Max, aiming to utilize GPUs for parallelism. They employed Nvidia's CUDA set for this. However, they found that the gaming tools prioritized performance over photorealism, which was not suitable for their needs. To overcome this, they extended these tools, filled gaps, and leveraged GPUs to create a detailed model of the site and architecture specifications. 

However, the engine slowed significantly when used for different geometries and vertices, presenting a problem they had to contend with. In response to this, they focused on using Nvidia's latest chips, which are expensive but work well for parallelization computation. They did a lot of work in C++ to deal with this. However, they encountered many problems and had to contact the vendor for updates and fixes. 

In addition, they also worked on the Earth curvature problem, automating a previously manual process. They added offsets to relevant geometries and polygons. However, this didn't solve the problem as it slowed down the performance. In the end, they realized that not all customers required absolute precision across the entire landscape all the time. This allowed them to process geometries smarter, grouping geometries or polygons with similar characteristics. Once grouped, their computation points interacted with the lead node of each cluster. They then applied offsets to the lead node and its cluster members. 

The outcomes of these attempts were that they were able to improve the performance but not enough to make the product usable. They were also able to build support for Earth curvature in 3DS Max, but this also had its limitations. However, they plan to release tools on GitHub and discuss their travels in a trade publication. 

The specific topics that the business plans to discuss in the trade publication will depend on the particular trade magazine or journal. They intend to share their experiences and challenges in overcoming the technical uncertainties, the strategies they employed, and the outcomes of their attempts. This will include their work on the Earth curvature problem, their use of Nvidia's latest chips and the Unreal Gaming engine, and their efforts to improve performance and precision in architectural
